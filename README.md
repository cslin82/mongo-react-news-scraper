# Mongo News Scraper with React

## Task

This full-stack single-page news app adds a React front end to the previous Mongo News Scraper. It continues to use Express, Node.js, Mongoose/MongoDB, and cheerio to allow users to save/unsave and comment on posts from the [Mozilla Blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/). It also introduces conversion of a server-rendered app to a React app.

## Concepts and technologies

* New: React, React Router, controlled forms
* New: RESTful API creation
* Mongoose and MongoDB
* Scraping server-side using cheerio
* Express.js running on Node.js
* Writing APIs and calls from frontend
* NPM for JS library management
* Custom Node.js modules and modular design, spreading logic and data across multiple files
* Deploying full MERN stack apps to Heroku

## Enhancements

* Add UI for scraping deeper
* Incorporate data validation
* Write mocha/chai tests

## TODO

* Write help page
* Clean up code and logic
* Consolidate methods
* Make deletes also delete ref in article model
* Use return data from API AJAX calls
* Convert scrape request to axios
